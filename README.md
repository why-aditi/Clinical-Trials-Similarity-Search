# Clinical-Trials-Similarity-Search

## Overview
This project uses **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for creating embeddings from high-dimensional data and **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpreting feature contributions in model predictions. The goal is to identify impactful features, improve transparency, and extract insights from the dataset.

## Features
1. **Efficient Embedding Creation**:
   - Leverages FAISS for handling high-dimensional data efficiently.
   - Enables similarity search and compact representation of data points.

2. **SHAP for Feature Interpretability**:
   - Explains individual feature contributions to the modelâ€™s predictions.
   - Provides visual insights using SHAP summary plots.
